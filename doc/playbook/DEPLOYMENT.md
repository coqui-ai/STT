Now that you have [trained](TRAINING.md) and [evaluated](TESTING.md) your model, you are ready to use it for _inference_ - where spoken phrases - _utterances_ - are assessed by your trained model and a text _transcription_ provided.

There are some things to be aware of during this stage of the process.

## Protocol buffer and memory mappable file formats

By default, üê∏STT will export the trained model as a `.pb` file, such as:

```
$ sudo ls -las volumes/stt-data/_data/exported-model

     4 drwxr-xr-x 2 root root      4096 Feb  1 22:13 .
     4 drwxr-xr-x 6 root root      4096 Feb  1 22:23 ..
     4 -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root      1586 Feb  1 22:13 author_model_0.0.1.md
184488 -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 188915369 Feb  1 22:13 output_graph.pb
```

A `.pb` file is a [protocol buffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_Buffers) file. Protocol buffer is a widely used file format for trained models, but it has a significant downsides. It is not _memory mappable_. [Memory mappable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_file) files can be referenced by the operating system using a _file descriptor_, and they consume far less memory than non-memory-mappable files. Protocol buffer files also tend to be much larger than memory-mappable files.

Most inference libraries, such as TensorFlow, require a memory-mappable format.

There are two formats in particular that you should be familiar with.

## Exporting a memory mappable protocol buffer file with `graphdef`

Using the `graphdef` tool which is built in to TensorFlow (but deprecated in TensorFlow 2.3), you can export a memory-mappable protocol buffer file using the following commands:

```
convert_graphdef_memmapped_format --in_graph=output_graph.pb --out_graph=output_graph.pbmm
```

where `--in_graph` is a path to your `.pb` file and `--out_graph` is a path to the exported memory-mappable protocol buffer file.

```
root@12a4ee8ce1ed:/STT# ./convert_graphdef_memmapped_format \
  --in_graph="persistent-data/exported-model/output_graph.pb" \
  --out_graph="persistent-data/exported-model/output_graph.pbmm"

For [more information on creating a memory-mappable protocol buffer file, consult the documentation](https://stt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/TRAINING.html#exporting-a-model-for-inference).

***Be aware that this file format is likely to be deprecated in the future. We strongly recommend the use of `tflite`.***

## Exporting a tflite model

The `tflite` engine ([more information on tflite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/)) is designed to allow inference on mobile, IoT and embedded devices. If you have _not_ yet trained a model, and you want to export a model compatible with `tflite`, you will need to use the `--export_tflite` flags with the `train.py` script. For example:

```
python3 train.py \
  --train_files stt-data/cv-corpus-6.1-2020-12-11/id/clips/train.csv \
  --dev_files stt-data/cv-corpus-6.1-2020-12-11/id/clips/dev.csv \
  --test_files stt-data/cv-corpus-6.1-2020-12-11/id/clips/test.csv \
  --checkpoint_dir stt-data/checkpoints \
  --export_dir stt-data/exported-model \
  --export_tflite
```

If you have _already_ trained a model, and wish to export to `tflite` format, you can re-export it by specifying the same `checkpoint_dir` that you used for training, and by passing the `--export_tflite` parameter.

Here is an example:

```

python3 train.py \
   --checkpoint_dir persistent-data/checkpoints \
   --export_dir persistent-data/exported-model \
   --export_tflite
