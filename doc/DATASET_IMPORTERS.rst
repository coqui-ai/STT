Data Importers
==============

We supply importer scripts for various publically available speech data sets. You can find these scripts in the STT repo under the ``bin/`` directory, but not all of the data sets are free. See ``bin/import_librivox.py`` for an example of how to import and preprocess a large, free dataset for training with 🐸STT.
