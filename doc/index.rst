Quickstart
^^^^^^^^^^

The fastest way to use a pre-trained üê∏STT model is with the üê∏STT model manager, a tool that lets you quickly test and demo models locally. You'll need Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 or 3.9:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Create a virtual environment
   $ python3 -m venv venv-stt
   $ source venv-stt/bin/activate

   # Install üê∏STT model manager
   $ python -m pip install -U pip
   $ python -m pip install coqui-stt-model-manager

   # Run the model manager. A browser tab will open and you can then download and test models from the Model Zoo.
   $ stt-model-manager
