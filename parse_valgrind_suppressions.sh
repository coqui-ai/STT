# A script to extract the actual suppression info from the output of (for example) valgrind --leak-check=full --show-reachable=yes --error-limit=no --gen-suppressions=all ./minimal
# The desired bits are between ^{ and ^} (including the braces themselves).
# The combined output should either be appended to /usr/lib/valgrind/default.supp, or placed in a .supp of its own
# If the latter, either tell valgrind about it each time with --suppressions=<filename>, or add that line to ~/.valgrindrc

# NB This script uses the |& operator, which I believe is gawk-specific. In case of failure, check that you're using gawk rather than some other awk

# The script looks for suppressions. When it finds one it stores it temporarily in an array,
# and also feeds it line by line to the external app 'md5sum' which generates a unique checksum for it.
# The checksum is used as an index in a different array. If an item with that index already exists the suppression must be a duplicate and is discarded.
