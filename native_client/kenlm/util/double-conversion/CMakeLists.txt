# If you add any source files to this subdirectory
#    that should be included in the kenlm library,

#    you should add them to the following list:
#
# In order to allow CMake files in the parent directory
#    to see this variable definition, we set PARENT_SCOPE.
#
# In order to set correct paths to these files
#    when this variable is referenced by CMake files in the parent directory,
#    we prefix all files with ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}.
