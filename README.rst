.. note::
   **This project is no longer actively maintained**, and we have stopped hosting the online Model Zoo. We've seen focus shift towards newer STT models such as [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper), and have ourselves focused on [Coqui TTS](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS) and [Coqui Studio](https://coqui.ai/).

   The models will remain available in [the releases of the coqui-ai/STT-models repo](https://github.com/coqui-ai/STT-models/releases).
